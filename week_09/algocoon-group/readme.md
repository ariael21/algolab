We are given a sculpture containing `n` individual figures and `m` limbs. The figures are connected to one another using several limbs. Our task is to cut the sculpture into two disjoint sets of figures. Each set must be non-empty, and the split should minimize the cutting cost.

At first glance, this problem may seem like a simple min-cut problem. However, the challenge lies in finding the minimum cutting costs between all possible non-empty, disjoint sets. To achieve this, we need to calculate the flow (both forward and backward, as flows are not symmetric) between the source (0) and all other vertices (â‰ 0) in the graph.
